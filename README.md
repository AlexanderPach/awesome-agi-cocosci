# Awesome Abductive Learning [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An **awesome** list for abductive learning, a machine learning methodology that combines neural perception with logical reasoning. The concept "abduction" is borrowed from cognitive psychology and can be interpretted as a mental process that try to find an interpretion to make observation fact consistent with background knowledge. We believe that integrating data-driven methodology with knowledge-driven methodology is a potential way towards our final goal: artificial general intelligence with human-level intelligence.
